    "text": "Introduction\nAs some people may know, I have been working on a project involving matrix- and tensor-valued time seris. In doing so, I often have to take derivatives of matrices and tensors with respect to other matrices and tensors. In this blog post, I will go over some basic rules that I have stumbled upon in my research, mostly because I have not seen any resources for this just yet. Additionally, this will make my life easier when I need to refer back to this in the future. If any one is interested in the basics of matrix calculus, I would refer to the Matrix Cookbook, or (hackbusch2014tensor?)."

    "text": "My name is Ivan and I am from Santa Barbara, California. I attended the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) and graduated with a degree in Economics. I then had to make a decision-either graduate with a minor in Mathematics or spend a year abroad in the Netherlands. I chose the latter and do not regret a single thing. I ended up finishing a masters in Economics and Financial Research spec. Econometrics and am now currently a PhD candidate at Maastricht University. The Netherlands has become my home away from home, and I have grown to love living here.\nDuring my time in the Netherlands, I found a passion for statistics and computer science. I learned as much as I could about programming and best practices, as well as how to apply it to my work. This includes:\n\nPrivacy and data rights\nOpen/reproducible science and open source programs\nBest coding practices for social sciences\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy bouldering, hiking, chess, and disc golf. All the photos you will see on this website will be from one of the activities mentioned here."
