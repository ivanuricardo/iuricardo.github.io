dimensions, as well as some dimensionality reduction.\nSome examples include:\n\n    - Countries and Economic Indicators observed over time\n    - Importing and Exporting countries observed over

time series labelled $\\mathbf{Y}_t$.\nA basic Matrix Autoregressive Model (MAR) is given by\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{Y}_t = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{Y}_{t-1} \\mathbf{B}' + \\mathbf{E}_t\n$$\n\nThis is taken from @hoff2015multilinear and @chen2021autoregressive and has close relation to the Singular Value Decomposition.\nThis also has a close relation to the standard Vector Autoregressive model, where we can vectorize all portion of the MAR to obtain\n\n$$\n\\text{vec} (\\mathbf{Y}_t) = (\\mathbf{B} \\otimes \\mathbf{A}) \\text{vec} (\\mathbf{Y}_t) + \\text{vec} (\\mathbf{E}_t)\n$$\n\nThese models are quite nice because they can explicitly model the relation between the row dimension and the column dimension of the matrix-valued time series.\nFor instance, if we have different U.S. states, and each state has a measure of inflation and unemployment, we can see whether there is a relation between the different states, or between inflation and unemployment **separately**.\n\nIn practice, these models are quite easy to implement.\nThe problem in many cases is that the individual portions (in this case $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$) are unidentified, meaning we can rotate the space, or scale the spaces and still obtain the same resulting VAR coefficient.\nSo in many cases, we will need additional identification restrictions, most likely involving orthogonalization constraints or scaling constraints.\n\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe field of matrix and tensor valued time series seems to have grown considerably over the past few years.\nThis has been
