My name is Ivan and I am from Santa Barbara, California.
I attended the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) and graduated with a degree in Economics.
I then had to make a decision-either graduate with a minor in Mathematics or spend a year abroad in the Netherlands.
I chose the latter and do not regret a single thing.
I ended up finishing a masters in Economics and Financial Research spec. Econometrics and am now currently a PhD candidate at Maastricht University.
The Netherlands has become my home away from home, and I have grown to love living here.

During my time in the Netherlands, I found a passion for statistics and computer science.
I learned as much as I could about programming and best practices, as well as how to apply it to my work.
This includes:

- Privacy and data rights
- Open/reproducible science and open source programs
- Best coding practices for social sciences

In my free time, I enjoy bouldering, hiking, chess, and disc golf. All the photos you will see on this website will be from one of the activities mentioned here.
