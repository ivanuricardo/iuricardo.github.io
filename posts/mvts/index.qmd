# Introduction

As some people may know, I have been working on a project involving matrix- and tensor-valued time seris.
In doing so, I often have to take derivatives of matrices and tensors with respect to other matrices and tensors.
In this blog post, I will go over some basic rules that I have stumbled upon in my research, mostly because I have not seen any resources for this just yet.
Additionally, this will make my life easier when I need to refer back to this in the future.
If any one is interested in the basics of matrix calculus, I would refer to the [Matrix Cookbook](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf), or @hackbusch2014tensor.
