description: Welcome to my blog. Posts here should not be mistaken with journal grade publications. What I write here is mostly what I learn myself and can therefore contain mistakes. Some blog posts are also just there so that I can structure my thoughts a bit. I publish these posts as a way to motivate myself to keep learning and as a way for others to learn alongside me. If you find any mistakes or have feedback, please leave a comment or get in contact with me. <br><br><span style="color:#98ceff;">I am still working on this part of the website. Please come back later to see what I am thinking about.</span>
